If you want a fresh install, and want to keep your files, you'll need another drive or somewhere to copy the files you want to keep over to. 
It may also be handy to backup your whole hard drive as a restore image just in case you want or need it, but just copying important files to another drive is good enough.

After copying the files you want to keep, go to (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) and get an ISO of windows 10. 
If you want 11, or whatever else, look for it in (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/) 
[Tip: use a mac, or phone to download the iso if you don't want to use the windows creation tool] 
You'll want to get a flash drive thats at least 8gb then:

to format the flash drive to FAT32 and make a bootable drive.

After that, plug in your usb drive if not already done, go into your BIOS and format your desired hard drive if it's not already formatted, 
set your BIOS to launch from the usb drive by placing it at the top of the boot order priority list, then load up. If everything goes right you should be able to install windows from your bootable usb drive. 
Select the hard drive to want to install windows to and follow the prompts.

You'll still have to activate windows for full functionality, but how you do that I will leave to your discretion.
